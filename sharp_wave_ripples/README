1) If you want to use the Human Brain Project cell models downloaded
from https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/ you first need to open the folder
"sharp_wave_ripples/mods" in a terminal
and write "nrnivmodl". This should compile the needed cellular mechanisms.
NEURON must be correctly installed on the system for this to work.

2) To initialize a population, go to the folder
"sharp_wave_ripples/sharp_wave_ripples", and write
"python cell_simulation.py". This should initialize the population and
run a cell simulation. A Figure should be made in a folder corresponding
to the cell model name. This assumed NEURON working with python, and the
software LFPy installed.

3) To run the population simulation and plot the results: "python main.py"
The results from every tenth cell is plotted during simulation. After all
cell models have been run, you can comment out the "simulate_population" line
to only produce the figures.
