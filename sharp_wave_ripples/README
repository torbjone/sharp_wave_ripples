1) If you want to use the Human Brain Project cell models downloaded
from https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/ you first need to open the folder
"sharp_wave_ripples/sharp_wave_ripples/hbp_cell_models" in a terminal
and write "python hbp_cells.py". This should compile the needed
cellular mechanisms.

2) To initialize a population, go to the folder
"sharp_wave_ripples/sharp_wave_ripples", and write
"python main.py". This should initialize the population and
run a cell simulation. A Figure should be made in a folder corresponding
to the cell model name

3) The script assumed you have MPI installed.
To run the population simulation: "mpirun -np 4 python mpi_run.py MPI"
The results from every tenth cell plotted

4) To plot population results write "python mpi_run.py"
